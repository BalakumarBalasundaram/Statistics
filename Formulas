Standard Error (SE) of Mean Calculator
SE - estimates the sample mean dispersion from the population mean for statistical data analyis.
   
Mean & Standard Deviation is used to estimate the degree of dispersion of the individual data within the sample.
SEM - helps to estimate the sample mean dispersion from population mean.

Sample mean
Ux = Summation of x / n

Sample Standard Deviation
s = Square Root of (1/n-1) * summation (individual elem - sample mean)2

Standard Error of Mean
SE = s / Square Root of n
